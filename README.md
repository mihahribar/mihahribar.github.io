===============

This is the content of my blog which resides at
[miha.hribar.org](http://miha.hribar.org). I used to run my site using
a custom built CMS but after a couple of years of procrastination I
decided to restart it and what better tool to use than
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [github
pages](http://pages.github.com).
