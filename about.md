My name is Miha Hribar. I am a dad, husband, *professional hobbyist*, Consultant, Co-Founder and
CTO of [Toshl](http://toshl.com) (mostly in that order). I'm always tinkering with various ideas whenever I find the time. You can see a list of my public
projects and contributions on [Github](https://github.com/mihahribar).
